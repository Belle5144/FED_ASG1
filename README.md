# FED Assignment 1: Creating a Website
I have created an e-commerce website to deliver a seamless shopping experience for families. The website is warm and inviting designed to cater to parents looking for high-quality playful products for their children. It features an intuitive interface with clear navigation allowing users to easily explore products, view details and complete their purchases effortlessly.

Key highlights of the website include an organized homepage showing featured and upcoming products,  product list page providing an overview of all available items, while a detailed product page with options for size and color selection and a smooth interactive login and registration system. The website ensures a user-friendly experience with responsive design making it accessible across devices.

## Design Process
The design of this e-commerce website is centered around the needs of parents, our primary users. They are often busy and may not have so much time to spend on shopping, hence they would seek for a convenient and efficient website to purchase products for their children. Their primary goals are to quickly find suitable items, access the details of the product and complete purchases in a short period of time. Additionally, the website caters indirectly to children, as the playful and engaging design reflects the fun and family-oriented nature of the products.

### How the website helps to achieve these goals:
The project helps parents to achieve their goals by providing an easy-to-navigate structure, so that they can explore featured, upcoming, and all available products without confusion. Detailed product pages clearly display information like size, color, pricing, and reviews, helping parents make informed choices. The login and registration features are designed to be simple and secure. The warm color palette and clean layout ensure the website is not only visually appealing but also works well across all devices. Additionally, the playful design adds warmth and charm, making the shopping experience more enjoyable and stress-free for parents. It creates an inviting atmosphere that encourages exploration, helping parents feel at ease while finding the perfect products for their family.

### User Stories

1. As a parent, I want to browse a product list, so that I can see all the items available in one place and easily choose what I need.

2. As a parent, I want to view detailed product information, so that I can make informed decisions about my purchases.

3. As a parent, I want a secure and simple login and registration process, so that I can save my preferences and track my orders conveniently.

4. As a parent, I want the website to have a warm and inviting design, so that I feel comfortable and stress-free while shopping.

5. As a busy parent, I want the website to work seamlessly on any device, so that I can shop conveniently whether Iâ€™m at home or on the go.

Hence, I created a wireframe to provide an overview of how my website will appear in both mobile and desktop layouts. This wireframe showcases the key design elements, including navigation, product listings, detailed pages and interactive features, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.
